# ♦️ Who am i?
— Hi, my name is Jean Henrique Bragagnolo, although you can call me Brag. I'am a 16 years old boy going through high school, i play volleyball, and i have a passion for languages. My pronouns are he/him. Started learning how to code this year (2021), so this world is kinda new for me.
#### ♠️ A few facts about me:
- Almost everything i know, I learned by myself (things like english, coding/programming). I guess that makes me a self-taught.
- I can speak english fluently since i was 13 years old, and i'am currently learning spanish.
- The thing that interests me the most on coding is frontend.
- Even though i like to take my time doing things, generally i'm a quick learner.
- My dream is to become a biologist, however, programming is conquering a huge space, very quickly in my heart.
